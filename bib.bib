  abstract = {We consider the problem of using a large unlabeled sample to boost performance of a learning algorithm when only a small set of labeled examples is available. In particular, we consider a setting in which the description of each example can be partitioned into two distinct views, motivated by the task of learning to classify web pages. For example, the description of a web page can be partitioned into the words occurring on that page, and the words occurring in hyperlinks that point to that page. We assume that either view of the example would be su cient for learning if we had enough labeled data, but our goal is to use both views together to allow inexpensive unlabeled data to augment a much smaller set of labeled examples. Speci cally, the presence of two distinct views of each example suggests strategies in which two learning algorithms are trained separately on each view, and then each algorithm's predictions on new unlabeled examples are used to enlarge the training set of the other. Our goal in this paper is to provide a PAC-style analysis for this setting, and, more broadly, a PAC-style framework for the general problem of learning from both labeled and unlabeled data. We also provide empirical results on real web-page data indicating that this use of unlabeled examples can lead to signi cant improvement of hypotheses in practice.},

  abstract = {Industrial big data and artificial intelligence are propelling a new era of manufacturing, smart manufacturing. Although these driving technologies have the capacity to advance the state of the art in manufacturing, it is not trivial to do so. Current benchmarks of quality, conformance, productivity, and innovation in industrial manufacturing have set a very high bar for machine learning algorithms. A new concept has recently appeared to address this challenge: Quality 4.0. This name was derived from the pursuit of performance excellence during these times of potentially disruptive digital transformation. The hype surrounding artificial intelligence has influenced many quality leaders take an interest in deploying a Quality 4.0 initiative. According to recent surveys, however, 80–87\% of the big data projects never generate a sustainable solution. Moreover, surveys have indicated that most quality leaders do not have a clear vision about how to create value of out these technologies. In this manuscript, the process monitoring for quality initiative, Quality 4.0, is reviewed. Then four relevant issues are identified (paradigm, project selection, process redesign and relearning problems) that must be understood and addressed for successful implementation. Based on this study, a novel 7-step problem solving strategy is introduced. The proposed strategy increases the likelihood of successfully deploying this Quality 4.0 initiative.},

  abstract = {Technologies associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution have demonstrated a significant impact on the productivity and agility of manufacturing companies, enabling them to be more competitive. The implementation of Industry 4.0 allows these companies to be better equipped to meet mass customization requirements. In Quebec, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the manufacturing industry don’t typically adhere to this technological trend, which creates a performance gap between them and their competitors. One of the main reasons Quebec struggles to keep up is that its SMEs do not seem to be equipped to make this digital transformation. The purpose of this paper is to identify, within a literature review, the prerequisites necessary to prepare manufacturing SMEs for the digital revolution. This review highlights different authors’ work to identify the most common prerequisites that are known. The results will help guide manufacturing SMEs to better prepare their readiness to implement Industry 4.0 and begin their digital transformation. With the results obtained from the research, combined with the design of experiments and a Monte Carlo simulation, it will be possible to validate the prerequisites. This will be done by implementing them in an aluminum product manufacturing SME in Quebec.}

  abstract = {Quality 4.0 corresponds to the growing digitisation of industry, which uses advanced technologies to enhance the quality of manufacturing and services. This fourth quality revolution is envisaged to digitise the entire quality systems and subsequently improve the existing quality approaches. Innovative industries adopt cloud-based quality 4.0 innovations in the controlled production process. It is used to resolve quality problems satisfactorily when they emerge and carry out real-time quality analyses to improve competitiveness and use them. Various ongoing challenges are take-over by Quality 4.0 technologies, such as automated root cause analysis, machine-to-machine connectivity to parameter auto adjustment, simulation of real-time processes and more. Quality 4.0 is a modern form of quality management. Digital technologies paired with more sophisticated methods and smarter processes will allow high-performance teams to provide consumers with high-performance and quality goods reliably. Sensors play an essential role in improving the quality of manufacturing and services. These can improve protection, increased internal productivity and sustainable operations.

  abstract = {Purpose:  To evaluate pix2pix and CycleGAN and to assess the effects of multiple combination strategies on accuracy for patch-based synthetic CT (sCT) generation for MR-only treatment planning in head and neck (HN) cancer patients. Materials and methods: Twenty-three deformably registered pairs of CT and mDixon FFE MR datasets from HN cancer patients treated at our institution were retrospectively analyzed to evaluate patch-based sCT accuracy via the pix2pix and CycleGAN models. To test effects of overlapping sCT patches on estimations, we 1) trained the models for three orthogonal views to observe the effects of spatial context, 2) we increased effective set size by using per-epoch data augmentation, and 3) we evaluated the performance of three different approaches for combining overlapping Hounsfield Unit (HU) estimations for varied patch overlap parameters. Twelve of twenty-three cases corresponded to a curated dataset previously used for atlas-based sCT generation and were used for training with leave-two-out cross-validation. Eight cases were used for independent testing and included previously unseen image features such as fused vertebrae, a small protruding bone, and tumors large enough to deform normal body contours. We analyzed the impact of MR image preprocessing including histogram standardization and intensity clipping on sCT generation accuracy. Effects of mDixon contrast (in-phase vs water) differences were tested with three additional cases. The sCT generation accuracy was evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Error (ME) in HU between the plan CT and sCT images. Dosimetric accuracy was evaluated for all clinically relevant structures in the independent testing set and digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) were evaluated with respect to the plan CT images. Results: The cross-validated MAEs for the whole-HN region using pix2pix and CycleGAN were 66.9±7.3 HU vs. 82.3±6.4 HU, respectively. On the independent testing set with additional artifacts and previously unseen image features, whole-HN region MAEs were 94.0±10.6 HU and 102.9±14.7 HU for pix2pix and CycleGAN, respectively. For patients with different tissue contrast (water mDixon MR images), the MAEs increased to 122.1±6.3 and 132.8±5.5 HU for pix2pix and CycleGAN, respectively. Our results suggest that combining overlapping sCT estimations at each voxel reduced both MAE and ME compared to single-view non-overlapping patch results. Absolute percent mean/max dose errors were 2\% or less for the PTV and all clinically relevant structures in our independent testing set, including structures with image artifacts. Quantitative DRR comparison between planning CTs and sCTs showed agreement of bony region positions to less than 1 mm. Conclusions: The dosimetric and MAE based accuracy, along with the similarity between DRRs from sCTs, indicate that pix2pix and CycleGAN are promising methods for MR-only treatment planning for HN cancer. Our methods investigated for overlapping patch-based HU estimations also indicate that combining transformation estimations of overlapping patches is a potential method to reduce generation errors while also providing a tool to potentially estimate the MR to CT aleatoric model transformation uncertainty. However, because of small patient sample sizes, further studies are required.},

Full use is made of the so-called “alpha-beta” pruning and several forms of forward pruning to restrict the spread of the move tree and to permit the program to look-ahead to a much greater depth than it otherwise could do. While still unable to outplay checker masters, the program’s playing ability has been greatly improved.},

  abstract = {Manufacturing enterprises are currently facing substantial challenges with regard to disruptive concepts such as the Internet of Things, Cyber Physical Systems or Cloud-based Manufacturing – also referred to as Industry 4.0. Subsequently, increasing complexity on all firm levels creates uncertainty about respective organizational and technological capabilities and adequate strategies to develop them. In this paper we propose an empirically grounded novel model and its implementation to assess the Industry 4.0 maturity of industrial enterprises in the domain of discrete manufacturing. Our main goal was to extend the dominating technology focus of recently developed models by including organizational aspects. Overall we defined 9 dimensions and assigned 62 items to them for assessing Industry 4.0 maturity. The dimensions “Products”, “Customers”, “Operations” and “Technology” have been created to assess the basic enablers. Additionally, the dimensions “Strategy”, “Leadership”, Governance, “Culture” and “People” allow for including organizational aspects into the assessment. Afterwards, the model has been transformed into a practical tool and tested in several companies whereby one case is presented in the paper. First validations of the model's structure and content show that the model is transparent and easy to use and proved its applicability in real production environments.},

The best known such systems are the expert systems. The research from which these systems are derived is called artificial intelligence. An overview of the field is presented with definitions, recommendations, and an example. Following the definition of terms and a brief history, potential roles which a symbolic processing system might play are discussed, with a brief summary of those which have been most successfully used. The various methodologies in use and their respective strengths are reported. Arguments about the best language to use (such as the choice between LISP and PROLOG) are addressed. A practical example is described in some detail. The strengths and potential of parallel architectures and neural-net machines are briefly noted.{$<>$}},

  abstract = {Background: As part of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC), prevalence surveys were conducted among representative samples of school children from locations in Europe, Asia, Africa, Australasia, North and South America. Subjects: 257,800 children aged 6-7 years from 91 centres in 38 countries, and 463,801 children aged 13-14 years from 155 centres in 56 countries. Methods: Written symptom questionnaires were translated from English into the local language for self-completion by the 13-14-year-olds and completion by the parents of the 6-7-year-olds. Rhinitis was described as a problem with sneezing, or a runny, or blocked nose when you (your child) DID NOT have a cold or the flu. Additional questions were asked about rhinitis associated with itchy-watery eyes, interference with activities and a history of hay fever ever. Results: The prevalence of rhinitis with itchy-watery eyes (“rhinoconjunctivitis”) in the past year varied across centres from 0.8\%(to 14.9\% in the 6-7-year-olds and from 1.4\% to 39.7\% in the 13-14-year-olds. Within each age group, the global pattem was broadly consistent across each of the symptom categories. In centres of higher prevalence there was great variability in the proportion of rhinoconjunctivitis labelled as hay fever. The lowest prevalences of rhinoconjunctivitis were found in parts of eastern Europe. south and central Asia. High prevalences were reported from centres in several regions. Conclusion: These results suggest substantial worldwide variations in the prevalence and labelling of symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis which require further study. These differences, if real, may offer important clues to environmental influences on allergy.},
