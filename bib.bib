  abstract = {Technologies associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution have demonstrated a significant impact on the productivity and agility of manufacturing companies, enabling them to be more competitive. The implementation of Industry 4.0 allows these companies to be better equipped to meet mass customization requirements. In Quebec, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the manufacturing industry don’t typically adhere to this technological trend, which creates a performance gap between them and their competitors. One of the main reasons Quebec struggles to keep up is that its SMEs do not seem to be equipped to make this digital transformation. The purpose of this paper is to identify, within a literature review, the prerequisites necessary to prepare manufacturing SMEs for the digital revolution. This review highlights different authors’ work to identify the most common prerequisites that are known. The results will help guide manufacturing SMEs to better prepare their readiness to implement Industry 4.0 and begin their digital transformation. With the results obtained from the research, combined with the design of experiments and a Monte Carlo simulation, it will be possible to validate the prerequisites. This will be done by implementing them in an aluminum product manufacturing SME in Quebec.}

A detailed virtual representation of the entire robot cell eliminates uncertainties regarding the feasibility of the assembly process in a defined robot cell during the design phase of the product with a CAD program. The necessary virtual representations of the robot cell components and the products to be manufactured are defined and the information interchange is explained.},

  abstract = {Manufacturing enterprises are currently facing substantial challenges with regard to disruptive concepts such as the Internet of Things, Cyber Physical Systems or Cloud-based Manufacturing – also referred to as Industry 4.0. Subsequently, increasing complexity on all firm levels creates uncertainty about respective organizational and technological capabilities and adequate strategies to develop them. In this paper we propose an empirically grounded novel model and its implementation to assess the Industry 4.0 maturity of industrial enterprises in the domain of discrete manufacturing. Our main goal was to extend the dominating technology focus of recently developed models by including organizational aspects. Overall we defined 9 dimensions and assigned 62 items to them for assessing Industry 4.0 maturity. The dimensions “Products”, “Customers”, “Operations” and “Technology” have been created to assess the basic enablers. Additionally, the dimensions “Strategy”, “Leadership”, Governance, “Culture” and “People” allow for including organizational aspects into the assessment. Afterwards, the model has been transformed into a practical tool and tested in several companies whereby one case is presented in the paper. First validations of the model's structure and content show that the model is transparent and easy to use and proved its applicability in real production environments.},
